# Mondarin-Drawing-Using-Grid
This is a project build using Grid, and its layout properties, I struggled with finding out how many columns and rows does the structure of layout has while building this project, but after figuring it out everything was easy, and I applied the properties that I learned in grid to style the website !. I had fun and struggled a lot.
